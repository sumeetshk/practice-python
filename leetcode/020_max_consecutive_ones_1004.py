# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

# Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

# Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
